# Some_Projects
Here are a few samples of the work I've done over the last few years. 
These projects use publicly available data or data shared with client consent 
and are great examples of the kind of work I’ve done supporting research in social sciences for the university where I was teaching,
and analysis I completed for clients. 
While I can’t share the actual projects due to confidentiality, I’m excited to showcase my skills and enthusiasm 
for diving into complex data, uncovering insights, and helping drive decisions. 
I’d love to chat more about how I can bring this expertise to your projects!
